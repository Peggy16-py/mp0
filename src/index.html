    <section class="bio">
      <p>Hello! My name is Peanut 🐾. I am the official supervisor of Peiyao Yang. 
      My main duties include monitoring long study sessions, sitting on keyboards, 
      and reminding my human to take breaks (usually by demanding snacks).</p>
    
      <p>Outside of work, I enjoy napping in sunbeams, patrolling the house at night, 
      and chasing toy mice. I take my job seriously, but I also make sure to add 
      plenty of purrs and cuddles to the workplace environment ❤️.</p>
